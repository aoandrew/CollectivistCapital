# Collectivist Capital
A new way to organize capital and entrepreneurial endeavours.

Core values: <br >
Generosity + shared destiny <br >
Belief in free markets + freedom + liberty <br >
Empowerment created by capitalism <br >

At the heart of capitalism is the company.  In Latin, _companio_, shared bread or with those you share bread with.

Over time, capitalism has shown itself to be the most effective way to deploy capital and talent and resources.

The core driver or source of strength in capitalist structures is capital; the drive for capital accumulation is a strong organizing force in society.  

Concentration of capital confers extraordinary power and influence on the capital holders but also has the ability to disenfranchise outsiders.  The anger of disenfrachised outsiders is often and for long periods of time suffered in relative silence but often this anger spills into very real and consequential social upheavals to equalize power imbalances.  Equal distribution equalizes power -- but enforcing equalization can create strange and sometimes destructive incentives or consequences. (#history)

We live in a situation where the top 1% owns 40% of America's wealth; the bottom 80% only owns 7% of the wealth.

The top 1% is 10 million times better off than someone in the bottom ~15th, and the top 1% is one hundred times better off than some at the 50% mark. 

If you look at startup equity - at the time of an exit at series D, the founder would be 125 times better off that someone hired in the time of the series D (so employee 350 to 750).

In other words, startup and enterpreneurship which is supposed to be the model and vehicle for economic mobility actually (almost exactly) mirrors the problem we are trying to avoid.

To take stock of our current sitaution; we're facing tremendous societal pressure due to wealth inequalty.  Technology and entepreneurship which was supposed to be the great societal equalizer is actually following the same pattern of the problem.
We need a different way forward.

The alternative to a pyramid structure of equity and wealth distribution for employees to startup would be a series of tiers?  Rectangles of increasing size.  (A parallelogram if you're viewing it at the right distance.).  This would amount to tiers of equity earned at equal rates by all employees at those tiers.

Imagine the following scenario: <br >
1% each for the first round of employees (20 employees) = 20% <br >
.2% each for the second round of employees (100 employees) = 20% <br >
.04% each of the third round of employees ( 500 ) = 20% <br >

The top 1% would only be 25 times better than someone at the 50% mark (the ratio is also the same at the 99% mark!) <br >

Continue to incentive those doing the early work.

## Appropriate projects
Highly utilized and popular companies that are disliked/distrusted by the community <br >

• CommunityUber => Money split 50/50 between drivers and technology <br >

## Incentives
• The tiered rectangle works to incentive those doing the early work.

• You'be much more likely to be highly selective in recruiting members of the team.  For each traunch the new people are very literally equal partners.  As an employee, I'm focused on making sure the new employee increases the value of my share. I'm less worried that a super-star new hire will outshine me and take my (higher) place in the equity pyramid.

• The equity percentage for new hires would be higher for 99.9% of people.  (This would exclude original founders and perhaps later senior management hired usually before acquisition.)

## Ecosystem
Role of equity + funders + workers + open source + consumer communities and consumer involvement: <br >

• The business plans, technology, art, and design need to be very much contributed to and completed in an open source way even before much of the work is started.

• The "win condition" for these projects is to create real community support (not just community "buzz") - but real engagement and real participation in these projects.  In other words, for this to succeed, it often needs the community to contribute to see this succeed.

• The need for secrecy is lessened, because the "first person" to kick-it off doesn't get a disproportional amount of equity -- it is the group that does.

• The future funders need to understand and want to be part of this ethos - it is a very different model of company creation and with it will need to come to terms with the fact that there is a very diverse set of equity holders.  Not exiting but allowing dividends to pay out may become a very real possibility for these companies which hightens the needs for these companies to produce real profits in a reasonable timeframe -- building hype-bubble buzz machines and looking and lookingfor a soft landing with an IPO is not really the "win condition" for these companies.

• There are many possible project but I can see the ecosystem grow in two ways: 
-- 1) a community/values-based alternatives for current companies, especially ones that are creating new categories of service but may have some justified reputational issues ("it's a horrible company but I love their service") 
-- 2) traditional local businesses that may have equity structures that load all the risk/reward on founders and workers are effectively shut out of reasonable upside 
-- 3) an evolution of open source projects that are currently funded by individuals and are often created either by a very small group of Patreon or Kickstarter funded creators, slightly larger groups organized via Open Collective, or by a much larger group of contributors to open source projects that do not have a reasonable way to organize and fairly pay/reward the contributors (their compensation usually comes in the form of jobs at companies their skills / or the projects they work on)

All the above types can transform industries and create tremendous economic opportunity and real accountability to industries as they stand today.

## Disincentives

• Projects based on life-long research will likely not be a great fit.  If that founder/research wants the value of that research to reflect in the equity table that could very likely be a problem.  To be considered: equity portions allocated to significant ideas/research (and those founders may have to *not* participate in the execution of the idea nor participate in the equity pool as described above lest the cap table look exactly like the typical patterns we see today -- this isn't a philosophical challenge, but may challenge the communities interest in supporting the initiative.).  A project like this would have to be the negotiated exeception; though I would love for this to become a normative experience as we would want to welcome all types of projects.

### Related concepts and considerations
UBI companies: <br >
Companies allocate $1k per month per employee to be distributed.  Each employee can pick one person not themselves (no restrictions. A family member would be the norm.)

Companies can choose to be Double UBI companies.  Allocate $2k per month per employee to be distributed.  Each employee can pick one person not themselves (no restrictions. A family member would be the norm.)

This would be optional but something that would generate community support in the project.  A company giving credit to an employee is not the same as UBI at a governmental level -- but it does fit with the ethos of Collectivist Capital, it does help introduce the idea of UBI to people, and theoretically if half of the country's companies (by number of employees) elects to become a UBI company then the country can be "covered economically"; the country sets itself up to be in a more economic stable situation and reaping the benefits that UBI promises.  Again, it is *not* the same as UBI distributed at the governmental level, but it is a step forward.

Another important point to make is that this is an opt-in decision, and it is important that the community respects that as we do not want to create pressure-filled, shame-based generosity; this is simply not the ethos.  It must be a self-directed, community and company and contributor-driven decision.

Transition plans: <br >
A company like CommunityUber would tap into customer discontent around the culture of the current company alternatives.  However, support in X years, all the cars on the road started to transition to AI driven vehicles.  A company like CommunityUber would never be able to succeed - it would inevitably fold.  So a community driven plan would need to drafted.  Something like - a AICarShare subsidiary would be drawn up.  Twenty percent of the initiavive would be owned by Community Uber (in exchange for technology transfer, marketing goodwill, etc.) but the rest of the equity could be earned by new employees of the initiative.  This addresses the practical reality of technology change that will materially affect the viability of any business.  (ie. Human-driven car rides costing $10 and driverless cars costing $5 will likely bankrupt any business of the first type in less than 6 months.).    

Radical opt-in transparency: <br />
Again, this is not required and very much opt-in, but it will likely build a lot of community trust to be very transparent with the equity distributions of the company.  In fact, having blockchain-mediated backend and company-on-the-chain and banks-on-the-chain scenarios can even make the financial flow throws even more transparent and obvious to employees.  Any employee at any startup will often scratch their head wondering who is getting what equity-wise; blockchain mediated companies can take all that guesswork out.  Also if the community is supporting the idea, seeing confirmation on an immutable blockchain will create confidence in the project.  The level transparency should again be totally opt-in and different levels of transparency should be expected (ie. revenue number, payouts, flows through different divisions and departments; personal privacy is as important as overall chosen transparencies.  Respecting the individuals and collective will of the people is incredibly important.

## Next steps
Create business plans, marketing plans, recruitment plans, open source technology plans for business ideas that could thrive under the above situations.

For selected percentiles, the following are the net worth brackets and breakpoints:

Net Worth Percentile:
10.0%	-$962.66
20.0%	$4,798.06
30.0%	$18,753.84
40.0%	$49,132.21
50.0%	$97,225.55
60.0%	$169,550.64
70.0%	$279,594.27
80.0%	$499,263.50
90.0%	$1,182,390.36

So the top 1% is 10 million times better off than someone in the bottom ~15th, and the top 1% is one hundred times better off than some at the 50% mark. 

If you look at the equity pool pool after Series A (which is probably the most generous picture) - the option pool would stand at 15% which could be distributed by 100 employees.  Let's say that is 0.015%.  After a Series A, the founders would likely have around 22%.  So that would mean the founder would be 1466 times better. 733 times better if we're talking about 2 founders.

For a Series D exist over 5000 companies, here are some results.
Founder ownership: 11-17%
Other employees: 17-21%
Investors: 66-68%

The number of employees isn't listed so let's say we're looking at 500 employees at the time of exit.

That would mean the founder would have 9.13% and an average employee would have .034%, or in other words, 250 times better. 125 times better if we're talking about 2 founders.
