At the heart of capitalism is the company.  In Latin, _companio_, shared bread or with those you share bread with.

Over time, capitalism has shown itself to be the most effective way to deploy capital and talent and resources.

The core driver or source of strength in capitalist structures is capital and capital accumulation which is a strong organizing force; however, the context and values of the people and culture where capitalism is practiced is incredibly important. 

Concentration of capital confers extraordinary power and influence on the capital holders and disenfranchises outsiders.  Equal distributions equalizes power -- but enforcing equalization can create strange and sometimes destructive incentives. (#history)

Rather than doing this - collectivist capital
