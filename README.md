# Collectivist Capital
A new way to organize capital and entrepreneurial efforts

Core values: <br >
Generosity + Shared destiny <br >
Belief in free markets <br >
Empowerment <br >

At the heart of capitalism is the company.  In Latin, _companio_, shared bread or with those you share bread with.

Over time, capitalism has shown itself to be the most effective way to deploy capital and talent and resources.

The core driver or source of strength in capitalist structures is capital; the drive for capital accumulation is a strong organizing force in society.  

Concentration of capital confers extraordinary power and influence on the capital holders but also has the ability to disenfranchise outsiders.  The anger of disenfrachised outsiders is often and for long periods of time suffered in relative silence but often this anger spills into very real and consequential social upheavals to equalize power imbalances.  Equal distribution equalizes power -- but enforcing equalization can create strange and sometimes destructive incentives or consequences. (#history)

We live in a situation where the top 1% owns 40% of America's wealth; the bottom 80% only owns 7% of the wealth.

The top 1% is 10 million times better off than someone in the bottom ~15th, and the top 1% is one hundred times better off than some at the 50% mark. 

If you look at startup equity - at the time of an exit at series D, the founder would be 125 times better off that someone hired in the time of the series D (so employee 350 to 750).

In other words, startup and enterpreneurship which is supposed to be the model and vehicle for economic mobility actually (almost exactly) mirrors the problem we are trying to avoid.

In sum, we're facility high society pressure due to highly heirachicial, high inequality, high concentration of capital.

The alternative to a pyramid structure of equity for employees to startup would be a series of tiers.  Rectangles of increasing size.  (A parallelogram if you're viewing it at the right distance.)

Imagine the following scenario: <br >
1% each for the first round of employees (20 employees) = 20% <br >
.2% each for the second round of employees (100 employees) = 20% <br >
.04% each of the third round of employees ( 500 ) = 20% <br >

The top 1% would only be 25 times better than someone at the 50% mark (the ratio is also the same at the 99% mark!) <br >

Continue to incentive those doing the early work.

## Appropriate projects
Highly utilized and popular companies that are disliked/distrusted by the community <br >
• CommunityUber => Money split 50/50 between drivers and technology <br >

## Incentives
• The tiered rectangle works to incentive those doing the early work.
• You'be much more likely to be highly selective in recruiting members of the team.  For each traunch the new people are very literally equal partners.  As an employee, I'm focused on making sure the new employee increases the value of my share. I'm less worried that a super-star new hire will outshine me and take my (higher) place in the equity pyramid.
• The equity percentage for new hires would be higher for 99.9% of people.  (This would exclude original founders and perhaps later senior management hired usually before acquisition.)

## Disincentives
• Projects based on life-long research will likely not be a great fit.  If that founder/research wants the value of that research to reflect in the equity table that could very likely be a problem.  To be considered: equity portions allocated to significant ideas/research (and those founders may have to *not* participate in the execution of the idea nor participate in the equity pool as described above lest the equity portion end up exactly from where we started.).  This would have be the negotiated execption -- the spirit of what is happened would more likely be business plans, technology, art, design to be very much contributed in an open source way even before much of the work is started.

## Ecosystem
Role of equity + funders + workers + open source + consumer communities and consumer involvement: <br >
• The business plans, technology, art, design to be very much contributed in an open source way even before much of the work is started.



UBI companies: <br >
Companies allocate $1k per month per employee to be distributed.  Each employee can pick one person not themselves (no restrictions. A family member would be the norm.)

Companies can choose to be Double UBI companies.  Allocate $2k per month per employee to be distributed.  Each employee can pick one person not themselves (no restrictions. A family member would be the norm.)






## REFERENCE ONLY

For selected percentiles, the following are the net worth brackets and breakpoints:

Net Worth Percentile:
10.0%	-$962.66
20.0%	$4,798.06
30.0%	$18,753.84
40.0%	$49,132.21
50.0%	$97,225.55
60.0%	$169,550.64
70.0%	$279,594.27
80.0%	$499,263.50
90.0%	$1,182,390.36
95.0%	$2,377,985.22
99.0%	$10,374,030.10

So the top 1% is 10 million times better off than someone in the bottom ~15th, and the top 1% is one hundred times better off than some at the 50% mark. 

If you look at the equity pool pool after Series A (which is probably the most generous picture) - the option pool would stand at 15% which could be distributed by 100 employees.  Let's say that is 0.015%.  After a Series A, the founders would likely have around 22%.  So that would mean the founder would be 1466 times better. 733 times better if we're talking about 2 founders.

For a Series D exist over 5000 companies, here are some results.
Founder ownership: 11-17%
Other employees: 17-21%
Investors: 66-68%

The number of employees isn't listed so let's say we're looking at 500 employees at the time of exit.

That would mean the founder would have 9.13% and an average employee would have .034%, or in other words, 250 times better. 125 times better if we're talking about 2 founders.
